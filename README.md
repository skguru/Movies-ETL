# Movies-ETL Challenge


Function is created to take three arguments- wikipedia data, kaggle metadata and movielens rating data (from kaggle)

Used try-except where appropriate throughout the coding process.  

Two tables were created in the database movie-data

-movies

-ratings

After many attempts - used Git lfs along with various github methods, still couldn't upload the large files onto Github.  That's the reason I couldn't upload the csv files onto the repository.  

The python code challenge.py will work fine as expected in the challenge, if those two csv files "movies_metadata.csv" and "ratings.csv" are under Movies-ETL repository. Unfortunately I couldn't have that in the github repository.
